# LinkedIn Job Trend Analysis

This project scrapes job listings from LinkedIn to analyze skill demand trends across cities and roles, specifically focusing on the **Data Analyst** role. The project processes the scraped data to identify the top skills required and visualizes them using heatmaps. It also generates insights for businesses and job seekers to understand the market demand for various skills across different locations.

## 📌 **Objective**

- Scrape LinkedIn job postings for the role of **Data Analyst** (or other roles) to analyze skill demand trends.
- Clean and parse the job descriptions to extract relevant skills.
- Generate heatmaps to visualize the demand for top skills across various cities.
- Provide a **Skill vs. City Matrix** and **Job Demand Recommendations** based on the analysis.

## 🛠 **Tools & Libraries Used**

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:**
  - `requests` (for sending HTTP requests)
  - `BeautifulSoup` (for scraping job listings from LinkedIn)
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation and analysis)
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (for data visualization)
- **Others:**
  - **Time module** (to add delays between requests and respect LinkedIn's terms)

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedin-job-trend-analysis.git
cd linkedin-job-trend-analysis
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, install the necessary libraries manually:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### **3. Modify Configuration (Optional)**

You can adjust the `keywords` and `location` in the script to scrape different job roles and locations. For example, to scrape for **Software Engineer** jobs in **California**, change the values as shown below:

```python
keywords = "Software Engineer"
location = "California"
```

### **4. Run the Script**

Run the Python script:

```bash
python linkedin_job_analysis.py
```

### **5. Output Files**

The script will generate the following output files:

- **`linkedin_job_data.csv`**: A CSV file containing scraped job data including job titles, companies, cities, descriptions, and associated skills.
- **`skill_vs_city_matrix.csv`**: A CSV file containing a matrix of skill demand by city.

### **6. Visualizations**

- **Heatmap**: The script will generate a heatmap showing the top 10 skills and their demand across different cities.

## 📊 **Data Visualization**

The analysis includes a **heatmap** showing the demand for top 10 skills across cities, providing valuable insights for job seekers and businesses.

### **Example Heatmap**

- The x-axis represents the **top 10 skills**.
- The y-axis represents the **cities**.
- The values in the heatmap represent the **demand** for each skill in each city.

## 🧰 **How It Works**

1. **Web Scraping**: The script uses **BeautifulSoup** to scrape job listings from LinkedIn. It extracts job titles, company names, job locations, and descriptions.
2. **Skill Matching**: The job descriptions are scanned for a list of predefined skills (e.g., Python, SQL, Data Visualization). Skills are then matched and stored.
3. **Data Cleaning & Analysis**: The skills data is cleaned, and a **pivot table** is created to analyze the number of job postings requiring each skill in each city.
4. **Visualization**: A heatmap is generated to show the skill demand trends across cities.
5. **Exporting Data**: All the results are saved in CSV files for further analysis.

## 📝 **Limitations & Notes**

- **LinkedIn Terms of Service**: Web scraping of LinkedIn may violate their terms of service. This script is for educational purposes, and scraping should be done with caution.
- **Dynamic Content**: LinkedIn pages are dynamic, and the structure of the HTML might change over time. You may need to adjust the script if LinkedIn changes their page layout.
- **Rate Limiting**: The script includes a `time.sleep(1)` delay between requests to avoid being blocked for making too many requests in a short time.
